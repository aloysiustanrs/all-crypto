I created this website on April 2022 in order to learn how to do web scraping of data and display it in an informative and interesting way.

Using the Coingecko and GNews API, I was able to create a cryptocurrency website which display the latest and realtime information on the crypto markets.

I also added a Firebase functionality that authenticates the user's email and also allow them to add/delete their favourite coins and it will be saved to the Firebase database which still store this information.
